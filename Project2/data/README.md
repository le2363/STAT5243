# ADS Mini Project 2: How do cells respond to different drug treatments
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only. I have uploaded two data folders (example and downsampled) which each include the images (.tiff) used in the analysis. The .csv file which includes the metadata information can also be found here as: metadata_BR00116991.csv
